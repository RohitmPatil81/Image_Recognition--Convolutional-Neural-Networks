# Introduction

This project focuses on identifying various agricultural crops from images supplied through URLs. It utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, a popular deep learning technique for image recognition tasks. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of crop images and achieves high accuracy in classifying images into specific crop categories.

---

# Features
- **Image Classification**: Accurately classifies crops based on input images obtained via URLs.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Supports real-time image processing and predictions using pre-trained CNN models such as **ResNet** or **MobileNet**.
- **Customizable**: The model can be fine-tuned and retrained on custom agricultural crop datasets to improve accuracy.

# Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

- **Python
- **TensorFlow/Keras** or **PyTorch** (depending on your framework choice)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **OpenCV** or **Pillow** (for image processing)
- **Requests** (for downloading images via URLs)

# Dataset

The dataset for this project contains labeled images of various agricultural crops. A dataset you can use for training and evaluation is available on Kaggle:  
[Agriculture Crops Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdwaquarazam/agricultural-crops-image-classification/data).

---

# Model Architecture

The model architecture is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which excels at image recognition tasks. You can either:

- Use a **pre-trained model** such as **MobileNetV2** or **ResNet50** and fine-tune it for your specific crop dataset.
- Build a custom CNN from scratch if needed.

The pre-trained models are typically faster to train and achieve better results due to transfer learning.

---

# Training the Model

After constructing the CNN, the model is trained on the crop image dataset. The process includes:

- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy.
- **Optimization**: Optimizer like Adam or RMSProp.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy to measure model performance.

During training, the model adjusts its weights to minimize the classification error, progressively improving its predictions.

---

# Evaluation

Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated using the validation dataset. The key metrics used are:

- **Validation Accuracy**: Measures how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
- **Confusion Matrix**: An optional tool to better understand the performance across different crop categories.

# Usage

# Recognizing Crops from Image URLs

To predict a crop from an image URL:

1. **Download the Image**: Fetch the image from the provided URL.
2. **Preprocess the Image**: Resize it to the model's expected input size, normalize pixel values, and convert the image to a suitable format.
3. **Make Predictions**: Pass the preprocessed image to the trained model, and it will return the predicted crop category.

---

# Results

After training the model and evaluating it on a validation set, the following results can be obtained:

- **Accuracy**: Measures how well the model predicts the correct crop category.
- **Sample Predictions**: You can display a few sample predictions with their actual and predicted crop names for analysis.
  
For example, an image of a lemon can be accurately classified as a **Lemon** by the model.
